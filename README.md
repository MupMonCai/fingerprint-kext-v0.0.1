FingerprintSensor.kext
FingerprintSensor.kext is a macOS kernel extension (kext) designed to provide support for certain fingerprint sensors on Hackintosh systems. This project is currently under development and aims to deliver fingerprint authentication integration with macOS, potentially enabling biometric login (Touch ID-like functionality) in the future.

üöÄ Features
Low-level fingerprint sensor driver for macOS

Communicates with USB-based or SPI-based fingerprint devices

Initial support for fingerprint enrollment and matching (coming soon)

Works with select fingerprint sensors (Goodix, Synaptics, EgisTec ‚Äì device-dependent)

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This is an experimental kext designed for educational and research purposes only.
It is not guaranteed to work reliably on all systems, and may affect system stability.
Use at your own risk.

‚úÖ Supported Devices (WIP)
Goodix GF3208 (experimental)

Synaptics 0608 (planned)

EgisTec ET510 (planned)

üîß Installation
Ensure you are running macOS 12.0 or later.

Copy FingerprintSensor.kext into /Library/Extensions/

Run the following commands in Terminal:

bash
Sao ch√©p
Ch·ªânh s·ª≠a
sudo chown -R root:wheel /Library/Extensions/FingerprintSensor.kext
sudo kextload /Library/Extensions/FingerprintSensor.kext
sudo kextcache -i /
Reboot your system.

üîç Debugging & Logs
To debug the kext, use log show or dmesg after loading. The kext outputs logs with the tag FingerprintSensor.

üí° Development Notes
This kext uses macOS‚Äôs IOKit framework and communicates with fingerprint hardware via USB or SPI buses. Integration with biometric APIs is under research.

We are currently reverse-engineering protocols used by common fingerprint sensors. Contributions and hardware dumps are welcome!

üß† Roadmap
 Basic fingerprint capture

 Fingerprint template storage (local)

 Matching algorithm implementation

 Integration with macOS authentication framework (BIOMETRIC Kit)

 GUI preferences pane
